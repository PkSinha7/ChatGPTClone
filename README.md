# ChatGPTClone
I created an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT using Langchain and the OpenAI API. The chatbot also features a summarizer, which can condense the entire conversation into a concise summary, capturing the main points of the interaction.

# How To Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the required dependencies.
4. Obtain your secret OpenAI API key. You can find instructions on how to get it here: [(https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key)]
5. Save your API key in a secure location, and never share it with anyone.
6. In the command line, within the repository directory, type "streamlit run app.py" to start the application.
7. The ChatGPTClone application will open, prompting you to enter your API key. Once you've entered the key, press enter.
8. You can now start having conversations with the AI bot through the application.
9. After having a conversation with the bot, you can also use the "summarise" button to generate a summary of the entire conversation.
